        Graph databases are incredibly useful to find connections or patterns within our data. This will be a hands-on introduction to graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), showing examples of its use for investigative stories including the Panama and Paradise Papers, and teaching attendees how to build a graph of noteworthy individuals and match them with corporate data to see the networks involved.

        Fuzzy matching has become an increasingly important part of data-led investigations as a way to identify connections between public figures, key people and companies that are relevant to a story. This class showed attendees how it typically fits into the investigative process, and gave a practical introduction to using the [CSV Match](https://github.com/maxharlow/csvmatch) tool I developed.

        Data journalists tend to use relational databases -- data in table form -- using tools such as Excel or SQL to find stories. Graph databases are different, but incredibly useful for finding connections or patterns that would be difficult to spot otherwise. This two-hour session showed how to use graphs to identify relationships between people, organisations, and other networks.
