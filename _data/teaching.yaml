-   title: Finding needles in haystacks with fuzzy matching
    details: Fuzzy matching is a process for linking up names that are similar but not quite the same. It can be an important part of data-led investigations, identifing connections between key people and companies that are relevant to a story. This class covers how it fits into the investigative process, and includes a practical introduction to using the [CSV Match](https://github.com/maxharlow/csvmatch) tool I developed.
