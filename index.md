I'm a data reporter at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) in London. Previously I was at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/).

I also organise [Journocoders](https://journocoders.com/), a community of journalists and other people working in the media interested in developing technical skills for use in their reporting.
