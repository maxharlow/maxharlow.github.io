I work on the visual and data journalism team at the [Financial Times](https://ft.com/) in London.

I also co-run [Journocoders](https://journocoders.com/), a community of journalists and other people working in the media interested in developing technical skills for use in their reporting. Currently on a pandemic hiatus.
