I'm a newsroom developer at the [Financial Times](https://ft.com/). Previously I've worked at [the Guardian](https://theguardian.com/), [the Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://thebureauinvestigates.com/), and [Ordnance Survey](https://os.uk/)'s [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/).

I also co-run [Journocoders](http://journocoders.com/), a community of journalists and other people working in the media interested in developing technical skills for use in their reporting.
