I'm a software developer working with news and government organisations. Currently that's [Ordnance Survey](https://os.uk/)'s [Geovation hub](https://geovation.uk/). Previously I was the technical lead at [the Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://thebureauinvestigates.com/), and before that a developer at [the Guardian](https://theguardian.com/).

I also co-run [Journocoders](http://journocoders.com/), a group helping journalists and other people working in the media to develop technical skills for use in their reporting.
